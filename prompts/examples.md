## Style Guide — Tropical Magical-Realism Aesthetic

This section is the authoritative reference for every prompt written for this project. Read it before writing or editing any prompt.

### The Aesthetic: Tropical Magical-Realism

We generate illustrations that look like **hand-painted Latin American folk art infused with magical-realism elements** — everyday scenes where something luminous or impossible is happening and nobody in the scene finds it strange.

Think of it as: the warmth and pattern density of Mexican papel picado meets the quiet surrealism of Gabriel García Márquez, rendered as a painted illustration.

**Core traits:**
- **Hand-painted feel** — visible brushwork texture, flat-to-moderate depth, no photorealism
- **Magical elements treated as ordinary** — glowing scrolls, light particles, translucent figures are part of the scene, not special effects
- **Dense, lush composition** — tropical foliage fills negative space; scenes feel alive and abundant
- **Warm luminosity** — light comes from within objects (lanterns, crystals, flowers) as much as from the sky

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex (approximate) | Usage |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Deep magenta | `#B5179E` | Primary accent, flowers, ribbons, banners |
| Teal | `#118AB2` | Water, sky accents, cool balance |
| Emerald green | `#2D6A4F` | Foliage, vegetation, grounding element |
| Warm gold | `#E9C46A` | Light sources, keys, sacred/important objects |
| Coral | `#F4845F` | Warmth accents, secondary flowers, fabric |
| Amber | `#E76F51` | Sunset tones, lantern glow, earth tones |

**Palette rules:**
- Every image should feature **at least 3** of these colors prominently
- Gold is reserved for light sources and objects of significance (keys, scrolls, bridges)
- Magenta and teal create the primary contrast pair
- Emerald grounds the scene — it's almost always present as foliage

### Mood & Lighting

- **Mood:** Warmth, community, luminous energy, quiet wonder
- **Lighting direction:** Warm side-lighting or diffused golden light. Avoid harsh overhead or flat lighting.
- **Light sources:** Prefer diegetic light — lanterns, glowing objects, bioluminescent plants. "Warm afternoon light," "soft warm gold light," "golden sunrise glow" are reliable tokens.
- **Avoid:** Cold blue light, dramatic shadows, noir lighting, overcast grey

### Composition

- **Resolution:** 1024×1024 (SDXL native). Do not change.
- **Framing:** Slightly wider than the subject — leave room for foliage and environmental detail
- **Depth:** Moderate. We want layered scenes (foreground objects, mid-ground subject, background foliage) but not deep perspective
- **Density:** Fill the frame. Empty space feels wrong in this aesthetic — tropical plants, flowers, patterns, or light particles should occupy margins

### Canonical Style Anchor

Every prompt **must** include this exact style anchor phrase:

```
Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration
```

This two-part anchor is non-negotiable:
- `Latin American folk art style` → triggers the hand-painted, pattern-dense, warm-palette aesthetic
- `magical realism illustration` → adds the surreal-but-ordinary quality and prevents photorealistic drift

**Do not** use shortened versions like "folk art illustration" or drop "magical realism." These weaken the aesthetic significantly — SDXL responds to both anchors together more strongly than either alone.

### The "No Text" Rule

Every prompt **must** end with `no text` as the final constraint.

SDXL frequently hallucinates text (signs, labels, watermarks) into scenes. The "no text" positive constraint combined with `text` in the negative prompt creates a double-block that is the most reliable text suppression method for SDXL.

### What SDXL Responds Well To

| Technique | Example | Why it works |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Specific color mentions | "deep magenta ribbons, teal water" | SDXL's CLIP encoder handles color adjective+noun pairs well |
| Named art movements | "Latin American folk art" | Strong training signal — produces coherent style |
| Lighting descriptors | "warm amber light filtering through foliage" | SDXL excels at atmospheric lighting when described precisely |
| Material textures | "weathered colorful doors," "mosaic tile floor" | Concrete nouns with texture adjectives generate rich detail |
| Emotional tone words | "sense of barrier and confusion," "playful and experimental mood" | Subtly influences composition and color temperature |
| "no text" as positive constraint | Placed at end of prompt | More reliable than only using negative prompts for text |
| Quality pair in negatives | "bad quality, worst quality" | SDXL training specifically associated these captions with low quality |

### What SDXL Responds Poorly To

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Do instead |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Negating colors ("no red") | Model attends to the noun, often produces *more* of it | Control color through positive palette tokens |
| Negating objects ("no trees") | Same attention problem — makes object more likely | Fill the scene positively instead |
| Vague style words ("nice," "pretty") | Too generic, no training signal | Use specific aesthetic vocabulary (see palette, mood sections) |
| Contradicting positive and negative | "warm gold light" + negative "gold" | SDXL can't resolve the conflict — produces muddy output |
| Over-long negative prompts (30+ terms) | Token blending kicks in, terms ignored | Keep negatives focused (our default is 11 terms) |
| SD 1.5 negative terms | "lowres, normal quality" | Different text encoder (SDXL uses OpenCLIP + CLIP). Use our default. |
| guidance > 7.5 for final output | Over-saturation, harsh edges, artifact amplification | Stay in 7.0–7.5 range for SDXL (see Parameter Recommendations) |

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- ✅ Start every prompt with the scene/subject, then layer in style, palette, mood, and constraints
- ✅ Include the canonical style anchor in every prompt (`Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration`)
- ✅ End every prompt with `no text`
- ✅ Use at least 3 palette colors by name in every prompt
- ✅ Describe light sources and their color temperature
- ✅ Use the default negative prompt for every generation
- ✅ Test at `--steps 20 --guidance 7.0` before committing to a long generation

**Don't:**
- ❌ Drop "magical realism" from the style anchor
- ❌ Use "folk art illustration" without "Latin American" qualifier
- ❌ Forget "no text" on any prompt
- ❌ Use guidance above 7.5 — it over-saturates SDXL output
- ❌ Write prompts longer than ~75 tokens (SDXL's CLIP truncates at 77)
- ❌ Copy negative prompt strategies from SD 1.5 guides
- ❌ Leave large empty areas in composition descriptions

### Negative Prompts

Always apply the default negative prompt (see [Negative Prompts](#negative-prompts-1) below). It suppresses common SDXL artifacts that clash with our folk art aesthetic.

## Prompt Template System

Every prompt follows a 5-component structure. This ensures consistency across the library and makes it easy to write new prompts that match the aesthetic.

### Template Structure

```
{scene_description}, {palette_hints}, {style_anchor}, {mood_and_lighting}, {constraints}
```

| Component | What it contains | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Scene description** | The subject, setting, and key objects. Be concrete and specific. | "A labyrinth of weathered colorful doors half-hidden by dense tangled vines and thorny tropical plants, each door painted in deep magenta, teal, and emerald green but locked and overgrown, narrow winding paths leading nowhere" |
| **Palette hints** | Explicit color references from our palette woven into the scene. Minimum 3 colors. | *(often embedded in scene description — "deep magenta, teal, and emerald green")* |
| **Style anchor** | The canonical style phrase. Always identical. | "Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration" |
| **Mood and lighting** | Emotional tone + light source/quality. | "dim amber light filtering through thick foliage, sense of barrier and confusion" |
| **Constraints** | Technical constraints. Always includes "no text". | "no text" |

### Writing a New Prompt — Step by Step

1. **Start with the concept.** What does this image represent? Write a one-sentence description (this becomes the `## Prompt NN — Title` heading).

2. **Draft the scene.** Describe what a viewer sees. Use concrete nouns with texture/color adjectives. Weave in at least 3 palette colors naturally.

3. **Append the style anchor.** Copy-paste exactly: `Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration`

4. **Add mood and lighting.** Describe the emotional feel and at least one light source with its color.

5. **End with constraints.** Always `no text`. Add scene-specific constraints if needed.

6. **Check token length.** Keep the full prompt under ~75 tokens. SDXL's CLIP encoder truncates at 77 tokens — anything beyond is ignored.

### Template Examples

**Minimal (fills all slots):**
```
A glowing tropical garden with magenta flowers and teal pools reflecting golden light, Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration, warm sunset glow, no text
```

**Full (production quality):**
```
A labyrinth of weathered colorful doors half-hidden by dense tangled vines and thorny tropical plants, each door painted in deep magenta, teal, and emerald green but locked and overgrown, narrow winding paths leading nowhere, dim amber light filtering through thick foliage, Latin American folk art style, magical realism illustration, sense of barrier and confusion, no text
```

## Parameter Recommendations

| Use case | --steps | --guidance | --refine |
|----------|---------|------------|----------|
| Quick draft | 20 | 7.0 | no |
| Blog quality | 40 | 7.5 | yes |
| Best quality | 50 | 7.5 | yes |

> **Note on guidance scale:** SDXL's sweet spot is **7.0–7.5**. Values above 7.5 cause over-saturation, harsh edges, and artifact amplification. The previous recommendation of 8.0 for "best quality" was above this sweet spot and has been corrected. If you want more prompt adherence, increase steps rather than guidance.

## Negative Prompts

Negative prompts tell SDXL what to suppress during generation. They are essential for maintaining the clean, illustrative quality our tropical magical-realism aesthetic demands. Without them, SDXL tends to introduce photorealistic artifacts, text fragments, and quality degradation that break the folk art style.

### Default Negative Prompt

Use this for every generation unless you have a specific reason to customize:

```
blurry, bad quality, worst quality, low resolution, text, watermark, signature, deformed, ugly, duplicate, morbid
```

### Why Each Term Is Included

| Term | What It Prevents | Why It Matters for Our Aesthetic |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `blurry` | Soft focus, out-of-focus areas | Folk art illustration demands crisp linework and defined shapes. Blur destroys the hand-painted feel. |
| `bad quality` | Generic quality degradation | Broad catch-all that pushes SDXL toward its higher-quality latent space. |
| `worst quality` | Severe artifacts, broken anatomy | Paired with `bad quality`, creates a two-tier quality floor. SDXL responds well to this combination. |
| `low resolution` | Pixelation, loss of fine detail | Our 1024×1024 native resolution needs full detail — especially in foliage textures and tile patterns. |
| `text` | Random letters, words, signage | SDXL frequently hallucinates text into scenes. Our prompts already include "no text" as a positive constraint; this negative reinforces it from the suppression side. |
| `watermark` | Watermark-like overlays | Training data artifacts. Shows up as semi-transparent stamps that ruin the illustration feel. |
| `signature` | Artist signature artifacts | Similar to watermark — inherited from training data. Appears as scribbles in corners. |
| `deformed` | Distorted anatomy, warped objects | People, hands, and architectural elements (bridges, doors) in our prompts need structural integrity. |
| `ugly` | Aesthetically unpleasant output | Broad suppression term. Pushes generation toward the more visually appealing region of the latent space. |
| `duplicate` | Repeated elements, clone artifacts | Prevents doubled flowers, duplicated figures, or mirrored scene elements that break composition. |
| `morbid` | Dark, disturbing imagery | Our mood is warmth and community. This prevents the model from drifting toward unsettling interpretations of words like "ancient," "faded," or "translucent forms." |

### When to Customize vs. Use the Default

**Always start with the default.** Then add scene-specific terms only when you see unwanted artifacts in test generations.

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Standard blog image generation | Use the default as-is |
| Prompt includes people/figures | Add: `bad hands, extra fingers, extra limbs, missing fingers` |
| Prompt includes architecture (bridges, doors, buildings) | Add: `cropped, out of frame` to keep structures complete |
| Prompt includes fine patterns (tilework, circuit patterns) | Add: `jpeg artifacts, compression artifacts` to preserve detail |
| You see photorealistic drift in outputs | Add: `photorealistic, 3d render, photograph` to reinforce the illustration style |
| You see unwanted dark mood | Add: `dark, gloomy, horror` to keep the warm folk art tone |

**Never remove** `text`, `watermark`, or `signature` from the default — these are nearly always needed for SDXL.

### SDXL-Specific Negative Prompt Tips

**What works well with SDXL:**
- **Quality pair:** `bad quality, worst quality` together is more effective than either alone. SDXL's training specifically associates these captions with low-quality images.
- **Style negation is powerful:** If output drifts photorealistic, negating `photorealistic, 3d render, photograph` is more effective than adding more positive style tokens.
- **Anatomical terms:** `deformed, extra fingers, bad hands` dramatically improves any prompt that includes human figures. Our "Knowledge Persistence" and "Hotel Staff" prompts benefit from this.
- **"no text" in positive + `text` in negative:** Double-blocking text generation from both sides is the most reliable way to prevent text artifacts in SDXL.

**What doesn't work (or backfires):**
- **Over-long negative prompts (30+ terms):** SDXL starts ignoring or blending terms. Keep the negative prompt focused — the default (11 terms) is in the sweet spot.
- **Negating colors:** Don't add `red` or `blue` to negatives to avoid certain colors. SDXL handles color negation poorly and you'll get muddy, desaturated output. Control color through the positive prompt palette instead.
- **Negating specific objects:** `no trees` or `no birds` in negatives often makes those objects *more* likely to appear (the model attends to the noun). Use composition in the positive prompt to fill the scene instead.
- **Contradicting positive tokens:** If your positive prompt says "warm gold light" don't put `gold` in the negative. SDXL can't resolve the conflict and produces unpredictable results.
- **Copying negative prompts from SD 1.5 guides:** SDXL uses a different text encoder (OpenCLIP + CLIP). Terms like `lowres, normal quality` that worked for SD 1.5 have weaker or no effect on SDXL. Stick to the terms in our default.

### Usage with generate.py

Once `--negative-prompt` is supported (see issue #3), the recommended invocation is:

```bash
python generate.py \
  --prompt "Your scene prompt here" \
  --negative-prompt "blurry, bad quality, worst quality, low resolution, text, watermark, signature, deformed, ugly, duplicate, morbid" \
  --seed 42 --refine
```

Until the flag is available, the default negative prompt should be hardcoded in the pipeline as the fallback when no `--negative-prompt` is provided.
