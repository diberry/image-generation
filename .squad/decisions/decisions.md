## PR #9: TDD Green Phase — OOMError + batch_generate() Implementation

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Author:** Trinity (Backend Dev) with Morpheus code review
**Branch:** `squad/tdd-batch-oom-tests`
**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVE — Merge to main**

### OOMError Implementation

```python
class OOMError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when GPU/MPS runs out of memory during generation."""
    pass
```

Placed before `parse_args()`, importable from generate module.

**Detection logic in generate():**
- CUDA OOM: Catches `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` (torch >= 2.1, guarded by hasattr)
- MPS OOM: Catches `RuntimeError` with "out of memory" in message (case-insensitive)
- Message: "Out of GPU memory. Reduce steps with --steps or switch to CPU with --cpu." (mentions both options)
- Re-raises as OOMError, but finally block still executes unconditionally (Python semantics)

**Review checklist (6/6 OOMError criteria):**
| # | Criterion | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Subclasses RuntimeError | ✅ PASS | Proper exception hierarchy |
| 2 | Detects CUDA OOM | ✅ PASS | torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError with hasattr guard |
| 3 | Detects MPS OOM | ✅ PASS | RuntimeError + "out of memory" string match |
| 4 | finally executes after OOM | ✅ PASS | Lines 208-222 guaranteed by Python |
| 5 | Error message actionable | ✅ PASS | Mentions both --steps AND --cpu |
| 6 | Non-OOM exceptions propagate | ✅ PASS | bare `raise` re-raises non-OOM exceptions |

### batch_generate() Implementation

```python
def batch_generate(prompts: list[dict], device: str = "mps") -> list[dict]:
```

**Behavioral contract (7/7 criteria):**
| # | Criterion | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Calls generate() per item | ✅ PASS | Loop lines 235-248 |
| 2 | Memory flush between items | ✅ PASS | gc + cache clears if i < len-1 |
| 3 | Per-item errors handled | ✅ PASS | try/except per item, appends error dict |
| 4 | Empty list returns [] | ✅ PASS | No iterations, no generate() or gc calls |
| 5 | Result order preserved | ✅ PASS | Iterates and appends in order |
| 6 | Never raises | ✅ PASS | All exceptions → error dicts |
| 7 | Signature clean | ✅ PASS | Matches spec exactly |

**Implementation details:**
- Per-item flush: `gc.collect()`, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`, conditional `torch.mps.empty_cache()`
- Flush guard: `if i < len(prompts) - 1` (between items, not after last — avoids redundant cleanup after generate's final flush)
- Error handling: Exception caught, converted to error dict with original prompt, output flag, error message
- Seed handling: `item.get("seed")` for optional seed
- Device parameter: Converted to cpu flag for generate() call
- Consistent with existing patterns: Uses SimpleNamespace (matching args), cache clearing follows guard pattern

### Integration Verification (3/3 criteria)

| # | Criterion | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| 8 | Existing try/finally cleanup functional | ✅ PASS | All code intact, fully functional |
| 9 | OOM except doesn't interfere | ✅ PASS | Re-raised as RuntimeError subclass, finally executes |
| 10 | Code readable and maintainable | ✅ PASS | Inline comments, clear logic, good variable names |

### Test Results

**All 53 tests passing (2.67s runtime):**
- 22 regression tests (test_memory_cleanup.py) — validates PR #1–#6 fixes
- 17 batch_generate() tests (test_batch_generation.py) — validates batch semantics
- 14 OOMError tests (test_oom_handling.py) — validates exception handling

**Batch generation coverage (17 tests):**
- Per-item generate() invocation (3 tests)
- Inter-item GPU flushing (3 tests) with call-order verification
- Partial failure handling (3 tests)
- Empty batch edge case (2 tests)
- Result ordering and structure (4 tests)
- All-item failure (2 tests)

**OOM handling coverage (14 tests):**
- CUDA OOM detection and re-raise (3 tests)
- MPS OOM detection and re-raise (3 tests)
- finally block cleanup runs after OOM (6 tests)
- OOM message content (3 tests)
- State clean after OOM (2 tests)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. Exception safety guaranteed — finally block unconditional on success, OOM, interrupt, or any exception
2. OOMError properly designed — dual detection, version-safe guards, actionable message
3. batch_generate() contract clean — per-item isolation, inter-item flushing, graceful failure, order preserved
4. Error messages user-friendly — both --steps and --cpu mentioned
5. No functional bugs found
6. Code maintainable and tested
7. Consistent with established patterns

**Minor observations (non-blocking):**
1. MPS cache clear could be device-guarded for optimization, but safe no-op on non-MPS (negligible impact)
2. torch.cuda.empty_cache() called unconditionally on all devices (safe no-op, consistent with existing pattern)

### Decisions Made

1. **OOM detection is message-based for MPS** — MPS raises plain RuntimeError. String matching on "out of memory" (case-insensitive) is the only reliable cross-torch-version approach.

2. **Memory flush only between items, not after last** — Matches test contract exactly. Avoids redundant cleanup since generate() already flushes in its own finally block.

3. **batch_generate stays in generate.py** — Test imports from `generate`. No separate batch.py needed.

4. **except + finally coexist** — Python allows both in one try block. except re-raises OOMError, finally still cleans up. Correct pattern for "transform exception but guarantee cleanup."

### Production Readiness

✅ Both OOMError and batch_generate() are production-ready:
- Fully tested (31 new tests + 22 regression tests, all passing)
- Exception-safe (finally block unconditional)
- Error messages actionable
- Edge cases covered (empty batch, partial failure, all-fail, state clean after OOM)
- No VRAM leaks
- Ready for production batch workflows

## Fix-by-Fix Findings

### Fix 1: Latents CPU Transfer (MEDIUM)

**Status: CORRECT**

- `latents = latents.cpu()` is placed **before** `del base` and the cache flush. Order is correct — the GPU pin is released before `empty_cache()` runs.
- Device transfer back uses `latents.to(device)` inline at the refiner call site, not hardcoded `"cuda"`. MPS is respected.
- The `if device in ("cuda", "mps")` guard is clean — CPU path is untouched.
- One note: `latents.to(device)` is called inline and its result passed directly to the refiner. The `latents` variable continues to hold the CPU copy until `finally` cleans it up. This is benign — CPU tensors carry negligible VRAM impact.

### Fix 2: Dynamo Cache Reset (MEDIUM)

**Status: CORRECT**

- `torch._dynamo.reset()` is inside the `finally` block. ✅
- Guarded by `device == "cuda" and hasattr(torch, "_dynamo")`. Both guards are present and necessary.
  - `device == "cuda"` is correct: `torch.compile` is only applied on CUDA in `load_base()` (confirmed at line 72–75).
  - `hasattr(torch, "_dynamo")` protects against torch versions without the attribute.
- The comment correctly flags that if `torch.compile` is ever extended to MPS, the guard must be broadened.

### Fix 3: Entry-Point VRAM Flush (MEDIUM)

**Status: CORRECT**

- All three calls present: `gc.collect()`, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` (CUDA-guarded), `torch.mps.empty_cache()` (MPS-guarded).
- Located at the very start of `generate()`, before `load_base()` is called. Order confirmed in diff and test call-log tracking.
- Two-flush pattern (entry + finally) is intentional and correct. Entry reclaims fragmented VRAM from prior runs; finally unconditionally cleans up after this run.

### Fix 4: Global State Audit (MEDIUM — no code change)

**Status: CLEAN — agree with audit**

Scanned `generate.py` manually. All pipeline variables (`base`, `refiner`, `latents`, `text_encoder_2`, `vae`) are locals initialized inside `generate()`, not module-level. Zero process-persistent pipeline references. Clean architecture for a CLI tool called in batch.

---

## Test Review (9 new MEDIUM tests)

**All 22 tests pass (verified by running `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_memory_cleanup.py`).**

### Ordering / call-log tracking

- `TestEntryPointVRAMFlush`: All 3 tests use `call_log` + `side_effect` to verify the flush fires **before** `load_base`. Genuine regression guards. ✅
- `TestLatentsTensorHandling.test_latents_not_holding_gpu_ref_during_cache_flush`: Uses `call_log` to verify `latents.cpu()` precedes `mps.empty_cache()`. ✅
- `TestLatentsTensorHandling.test_latents_transferred_back_for_refiner`: Checks that `cpu()` and `to("mps")` are both called, but does NOT verify order. If someone swapped them, this test would still pass. Minor gap — not a blocker.
- `TestDynamoCacheReset`: CUDA test mocks the full `torch` module, correctly exercises the `hasattr` guard. CPU test correctly confirms `_dynamo.reset()` is NOT called on non-CUDA paths. ✅
- `TestGlobalState.test_repeated_calls_dont_compound_memory`: Tracks cumulative gc count across two `generate()` calls — verifies entry flush fires on the second call too. ✅

### Code smell: orphaned assert messages

Several tests use this pattern:
```python
mock.assert_called(), "this message is never shown"
```
The string after the comma is a valid Python expression but is silently orphaned — it's NOT a pytest `assert` statement. When the mock assertion fails, the custom message does NOT appear in the output. The underlying `assert_called()` still raises, so the tests catch regressions, but debugging is harder. Three affected tests: `test_latents_transferred_back_for_refiner`, `test_dynamo_reset_called_after_cleanup`, and `test_base_freed_before_refiner_loads`. **Not a blocker for merge, but Neo should fix this as a follow-up.**

---

## Verdict

**APPROVED.** All four MEDIUM-severity issues are correctly addressed. Code logic is sound. The 9 new tests use call-order tracking and would catch regressions on Fixes 1, 2, and 3. Fix 4 is verified clean by inspection.

**Follow-up (not blocking):** Neo to fix the orphaned message pattern in 3 tests and add call-ordering assertion to `test_latents_transferred_back_for_refiner`.

## TDD Sprint: Batch CLI + OOM Retry (PRs #10, #11)

### PR #10: OOM Auto-Retry with Step Reduction

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Author:** Trinity (Backend Developer)
**Branch:** `squad/oom-retry`
**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVED — Merged to main**

**Feature Implemented:** `generate_with_retry(args, max_retries: int = 2) -> str`

- **Behavior:** Wraps `generate(args)` with OOM retry logic
- **On OOMError:** Halves `args.steps` (floor at 1), prints warning, retries
- **Retries:** Up to `max_retries` times (so `max_retries + 1` total calls)
- **Exhaustion:** Re-raises `OOMError` with final steps count in message
- **Non-OOM exceptions:** Propagate immediately, no retry

**Test Results:** 12/12 tests pass
- All critical paths covered (step halving, max_retries exhaustion)
- Edge cases: steps=1 floor, all retry types

**Integration with main():** Single-prompt path now calls `generate_with_retry()` instead of `generate()`. Batch mode preserves existing `batch_generate()` path.

**Reviewer Note (Morpheus):** Future work should update `batch_generate()` to utilize `generate_with_retry()` logic for robust batch OOM handling. Currently batch fails immediately on OOM for a single item. Acceptable for this scope but inconsistent architecturally. Deferred as architectural improvement.

### PR #11: --batch-file CLI Flag

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Author:** Trinity (Backend Developer)
**Branch:** `squad/batch-cli`
**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVED — Merged to main**

**Features Implemented:**
1. `--batch-file <path>` argument (mutually exclusive with `--prompt`)
2. Extracted `main()` function from `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
3. main() handles both paths: --batch-file → read JSON → call batch_generate(), or --prompt → call generate()

**Test Results:** 10/10 tests pass
- All contract tests from neo-batch-cli-tdd-red.md satisfied
- Full regression suite: 63/63 pass (zero regressions)

**Error Handling:**
- Missing file → `sys.exit(1)` with stderr message
- Malformed JSON → `sys.exit(1)` with stderr message
- Partial batch failure → continues (per-item try/except in batch_generate())

**CI Constraint:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` uses `workflow_dispatch` only (no auto-triggers on push/PR)

**generate_blog_images.sh Refactor (included in PR #11):**
- Replaced 5 sequential `python generate.py` calls with single `--batch-file` invocation
- PID-namespaced temp JSON file (no /tmp usage, local directory)
- `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- Per-item seeds preserved (42–46)

### TDD Cycle Summary

**Neo's Red Phase Tests (2026-03-24):**
- tests/test_batch_cli.py: 10 tests documenting --batch-file contract
- tests/test_oom_retry.py: 12 tests documenting generate_with_retry() contract
- Both files syntactically valid, collected by pytest, all failing (by design)

**Trinity's Green Phase Implementation:**
- PR #10: generate_with_retry() implementation
- PR #11: --batch-file CLI + main() refactor + shell update
- All tests transitioned from red to green via implementation

**Code Reviews:**
- **Morpheus review PR #10:** APPROVED. Correctness verified. Safety validated. Testing comprehensive.
- **Neo review PR #11:** APPROVED. All 10 contract tests pass. Zero regressions. CI constraint verified.

### Architectural Notes

- **TDD Discipline:** Red phase tests documented requirements precisely. Trinity implementation satisfied all tests in green phase. Code reviews verified behavior matches spec.
- **Exception Safety:** 
  - Single-prompt path: `generate_with_retry()` catches OOMError, retries, delegates cleanup to `generate()`'s finally block
  - Batch path: Per-item exceptions caught, converted to error dicts, batch never raises
  - Both paths respect device handling and --cpu flag
- **Memory Management:** batch_generate() flushes GPU memory between items (gc.collect + device cache clears), following generate()'s established patterns

### Merged to main

Both PRs merged to main with all tests passing:
- PR #10: squad/oom-retry → generate_with_retry() implementation
- PR #11: squad/batch-cli → --batch-file CLI + shell update

Tests written and merged:
- tests/test_batch_cli.py (10 tests, all passing on main)
- tests/test_oom_retry.py (12 tests, all passing on main)

**Final test status on main:**
- test_batch_cli.py: 10/10 ✅
- test_oom_retry.py: 12/12 ✅
- test_batch_generation.py: 17/17 ✅
- test_oom_handling.py: 14/14 ✅
- test_memory_cleanup.py: 22/22 ✅
- **Total: 75/75 ✅ ALL PASSING**

### Future Work Note

Morpheus flagged that `batch_generate()` should eventually use `generate_with_retry()` for consistent OOM handling across both single-prompt and batch modes. Currently batch fails immediately on OOM for one item while single-prompt mode retries. This is acceptable for initial release but represents an architectural inconsistency. Deferred as future enhancement, not blocking current merge.
