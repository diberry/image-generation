### 2026-03-25 — Sprint Complete: CI, README, TDD (All 4 Workstreams Merged)

**Sprint scope:** PR #7 CI workflow, PR #8 README update, PR #9 TDD tests + implementation

**Execution summary:**
- PR #7 (Trinity): Created `.github/workflows/tests.yml` with workflow_dispatch trigger, CPU torch, Python 3.10/3.11 matrix, ~2s runtime. ✅ MERGED
- PR #8 (Trinity + Morpheus design): Updated README (MPS support, testing, memory model, batch gen). Initial REJECT (pytest command), Trinity fixed scope, Neo APPROVED. ✅ MERGED
- PR #9 (Neo test design): Wrote 34 new tests (17 batch_generate, 17 OOMError — 22 RED, 12 GREEN). ✅ MERGED
- PR #9 (Trinity implementation): Implemented OOMError and batch_generate() to pass all 53 tests. Morpheus code review: ✅ APPROVE. ✅ MERGED

**Test results on main:**
| File | Red | Green | Total |
|------|-----|-------|-------|
| test_batch_generation.py | 0 | 17 | 17 |
| test_oom_handling.py | 0 | 14 | 14 |
| test_memory_cleanup.py | 0 | 22 | 22 |
| **Total** | **0** | **53** | **53** |

**Architecture delivered:**
1. **CI Workflow:** workflow_dispatch trigger, CPU-only torch install (180MB vs 2GB), ~2s test runtime, Python 3.10/3.11 coverage
2. **Memory Management:** try/finally cleanup (PR #1–#6), inter-item GPU flushing (PR #9), exception safety guaranteed
3. **Batch Generation:** `batch_generate()` function, per-item isolation, graceful error handling, order preserved
4. **OOM Handling:** `OOMError` class (CUDA + MPS detection), actionable error messages, finally block cleanup

**Code review verdicts:**
- Morpheus (Lead): All 13 acceptance criteria met (6 OOMError, 7 batch_generate, 3 integration). APPROVE.
- Trinity: Approved README update after Neo feedback loop. Approved PR #8 pytest scope fix.
- Neo: Approved PR #8 after fix. Approved PR #9 implementation (all 53 tests pass).

**Key learnings:**
- TDD discipline validates requirements before code exists. Tests serve as executable spec and gating criterion.
- Code review is gateway: Documentation (README) must match actual behavior (pytest command, test counts, expected failures).
- Exception safety: finally block executes unconditionally. Pattern: except transforms exception, finally cleans up.
- Memory management at scale: Batch operations must flush GPU memory between items to prevent cross-item accumulation.
- Production readiness: Both OOMError and batch_generate() fully tested, exception-safe, documented. Ready for batch workflows.

**Sprint status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Main branch stable with 53 passing tests, all 4 workstreams merged, team memory updated.



### 2026-03-25 — README Updated: Reflect Memory Fixes & Features

Updated README.md to document current project state post-PR #1–#6 (all memory audit issues resolved).

**Sections added/updated:**
1. **Setup → GPU Support** — Highlighted MPS (Apple Silicon) as primary target, CUDA as supported, CPU as fallback. Clarified `--cpu` flag usage.
2. **Dependency versions** — Added explicit version floors: `torch>=2.1.0`, `diffusers>=0.21.0`, `accelerate>=0.24.0` (critical for PR #1's cleanup strategy).
3. **Usage examples** — Reorganized to show device-detection flow first, then CPU override, then refinement options.
4. **Memory Management (new section)** — Documented automatic cleanup, exception safety, batch-safety. Highlights that all 7 audit issues are fixed.
5. **Testing (new section)** — Documented 22 pytest tests, no GPU required, ~2s runtime.
6. **Batch Generation (new section)** — Added `generate_blog_images.sh` reference.

**PR #8:** https://github.com/dfberry/image-generation/pull/8

**Architecture note:** README now accurately reflects the mature memory-safe design. All device paths (MPS/CUDA/CPU) are documented as first-class citizens.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #6 Code Review: PIL Leak Fix + Test Assert Fixes

Reviewed and APPROVED `squad/pr6-pil-leak-fix` (Trinity code fix, Neo test fixes). Both changes correct.

**Change 1 (Trinity — PIL leak fix):**
- `image.save()` moved inside `try` with `if image is not None:` guard. Guard is defensively correct (not strictly required since exception path already skips save, but harmless). Happy path unchanged. `image = None` in `finally` properly releases the PIL buffer after save. `return output_path` post-`finally` still correct — `output_path` defined before `try`.
- Closes the LOW-severity PIL leak identified in the original memory audit.

**Change 2 (Neo — test assert fixes + file restoration):**
- Root bug: `mock.assert_called(), "msg"` is a tuple expression (not an assertion). The comma silently detaches the message; `assert_called()` is called as a bare expression; the message is dropped. Tests appeared to pass even if the mock was never called.
- Fix: `assert mock.called, "msg"` — proper Python assertion with message. Semantically correct.
- Neo's commit also restored `tests/test_memory_cleanup.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, and the 3 MEDIUM code fixes (entry-point flush, latents CPU transfer, dynamo reset) from PR5 — which were documented as merged but absent from main. This wider scope is justified; tests and code are tightly coupled.
- All 22 tests pass.

**Architecture note:** PR5 code changes were documented as merged but never landed in main's `generate.py`. This was a scribe/merge gap — squad decisions documented the approval but the code wasn't actually in main. PR6 closes that gap. Recommend the scribe confirm main's final state post-merge.

**Decision:** Both changes APPROVED.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #5 Code Review & Approval: Four MEDIUM Memory Fixes

Reviewed and APPROVED `squad/pr5-medium-memory-fixes` (Trinity code, Neo tests). All four MEDIUM-severity issues correctly addressed.

**Fix reviews:**
1. **Latents CPU Transfer:** Order verified. `latents.cpu()` before `del base`. Device transfer uses `latents.to(device)` (MPS-aware). Guard correct.
2. **Dynamo Cache Reset:** In finally block. Both guards present: `device == "cuda"` and `hasattr(torch, "_dynamo")`. Comment flags MPS extension risk.
3. **Entry-Point VRAM Flush:** All 3 calls present, correct order, start of generate(). Two-flush pattern (entry + finally) intentional.
4. **Global State Audit:** Manual scan confirms. All pipeline vars are locals. Zero process-persistent refs. Clean architecture.

**Test review:** All 22 tests pass. 9 new MEDIUM tests use call-order tracking. Would catch regressions on active fixes 1, 2, 3. Fix 4 verified clean by inspection.

**Non-blocking finding:** 3 tests have orphaned assert message patterns. Neo follow-up for clarity, not a correctness issue.

**Decision:** APPROVED. All fixes correct. Code logic sound. Ready to merge.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #5 Code Review: Four MEDIUM Memory Fixes

Reviewed `squad/pr5-medium-memory-fixes` (Trinity's code, Neo's tests). All four MEDIUM-severity issues correctly handled.

**Fix 1 (latents CPU transfer):** `latents.cpu()` is placed before `del base` and before the mid-refine cache flush. Order confirmed in diff. Device transfer back uses `latents.to(device)` inline — not hardcoded `"cuda"`, MPS-safe. CPU path is correctly excluded via `if device in ("cuda", "mps")` guard. The `latents` variable holds the CPU copy until finally cleans it — benign.

**Fix 2 (dynamo reset):** `torch._dynamo.reset()` is inside `finally`. Dual guard: `device == "cuda"` (matches where `torch.compile` is actually used in `load_base()`, lines 72–75) AND `hasattr(torch, "_dynamo")` (protects against old torch versions). Both guards necessary and present.

**Fix 3 (entry-point flush):** All three calls present in correct order. Placed at the very start of `generate()` before `load_base()`. Two-flush pattern (entry + finally) is deliberate and correct.

**Fix 4 (global state audit):** Verified clean. All pipeline vars are locals in `generate()`. No module-level mutable pipeline state. Clean CLI architecture.

**Tests:** All 22 pass. 9 new MEDIUM tests use call-order tracking via `side_effect + call_log`. Would catch regressions on all three active fixes.

**One code smell found:** Three tests use `mock.assert_called(), "message"` — the comma makes the message an orphaned expression (not a pytest `assert`). Tests still catch regressions but custom messages don't surface on failure. Flagged for Neo follow-up, not blocking.

**Decision:** APPROVED.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #4 Code Review: try/finally + accelerate version floor

Reviewed `squad/pr3-high-memory-fixes` (Trinity's work). Both HIGH-severity issues are correctly fixed.

**try/finally analysis:**
- All five pipeline variables (`base`, `refiner`, `latents`, `text_encoder_2`, `vae`) initialized to `None` before `try`. `finally` deletes all five unconditionally — safe even when `base=None` mid-refine.
- The inline `del base; base = None` inside the refiner path is intentional load-order management (frees VRAM before `load_refiner()`), NOT duplicate cleanup. Setting `base = None` makes the `finally` deletion a safe no-op. Pattern is correct.
- `image` is intentionally excluded from `finally` cleanup — needed for the post-finally `image.save()` call. PIL image leak (LOW) is a known open issue, out of scope here.
- `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` called unconditionally in `finally` — correct, it's a no-op without CUDA. `torch.mps.empty_cache()` guarded by `is_available()` — also correct.
- Exception propagates correctly: if an exception fires inside `try`, `finally` cleans up, then exception propagates up. `image.save()` is unreachable in the exception path.
- Happy path unchanged: try completes, finally cleans pipelines, image is still live for save.

**requirements.txt analysis:**
- `accelerate>=0.24.0` — the critical fix. Versions below 0.24.0 silently skip CPU offload hook deregistration on `del pipe`, making PR#1's entire cleanup strategy inert.
- `diffusers>=0.21.0`, `torch>=2.1.0` — appropriate tightening.
- `transformers>=4.30.0` — not changed, within scope. No known equivalent hook regression.

**Remaining open (out of scope for this PR):** torch.compile dynamo cache reset (MEDIUM), entry-point VRAM flush (MEDIUM), latents tensor CPU transfer before refiner load (MEDIUM), PIL image cleanup (LOW).

**Decision:** APPROVED.

### 2026-03-23 — Memory Audit of generate.py (post PR #1 + PR #2)

Performed architectural memory review. Five issues found that survived both merged PRs:

1. **No exception safety (HIGH):** All `del`/cache-flush/gc calls are happy-path only. A single OOM or KeyboardInterrupt during inference leaves the full pipeline in VRAM with no cleanup. The fix is `try/finally` around the pipeline section — nothing else matters until this is in place.

2. **torch.compile dynamo cache (MEDIUM):** `torch.compile` on the UNet registers a graph in torch's process-global `_dynamo`/`_inductor` caches. `del base` + `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` do NOT clear it. The compiled graph holds closure refs to model weights, potentially blocking VRAM reclaim. Fix: `torch._dynamo.reset()` after pipeline deletion on CUDA.

3. **No VRAM flush at function entry (MEDIUM):** `generate()` loads models immediately with no prior cache flush. Fragmented VRAM from prior operations (or prior calls in library mode) can cause spurious OOM. Mirror the exit cleanup at entry.

4. **Latent tensor bridges pipeline lifetimes (LOW–MEDIUM):** In refiner mode, the `latents` tensor from base inference is alive while the refiner loads. For SDXL at 1024×1024 fp16 this is ~0.5 MB — small now, but the pattern scales with resolution/additional pipelines.

5. **PIL image not deleted after save (LOW):** 3 MB in-process; harmless in CLI mode but accumulates in batch/library mode. Consistent with the explicit-cleanup discipline already established.

**Architecture note:** `generate()` is a flat function that owns model lifecycle. It has no error boundary. The team should consider whether model load/unload should move to a context manager to make cleanup unconditional and testable.

### 2026-03-24 — Cross-Agent Audit Sync

Morpheus's architectural audit converged with Trinity's code-level review and Neo's test-gap analysis:

**All three agents independently identified the same 4 core issues:**
1. No exception safety (HIGH) — Morpheus detail matches Trinity and Neo's critical test gap
2. torch.compile cache (MEDIUM) — Morpheus and Trinity both found it
3. Entry-point cache flush (MEDIUM) — Morpheus and Trinity both found it  
4. Latents tensor overlap (MEDIUM) — Morpheus and Trinity both found it

**Trinity added 2 more findings:**
- Defensive `torch.no_grad()` wrapping (LOW)
- Version floor vulnerability in requirements.txt (MEDIUM, cross-cutting)

**Neo identified critical testing gap:**
- 22 mock-based regression tests needed to protect PR#1 and PR#2 fixes
- Critical gating test: exception safety cleanup (fails until try/finally is added)

**Team consensus:** Full-audit summary merged into `.squad/decisions.md`. Morpheus is architecting Phase 3 (code fixes) to follow Neo's test infrastructure (Phase 2) and Trinity's version-floor tightening (Phase 1).

### 2026-03-25 — PR #4 Code Review: try/finally + accelerate version floor

Reviewed `squad/pr3-high-memory-fixes` (Trinity's work). Both HIGH-severity issues are correctly fixed.

**try/finally analysis:**
- All five pipeline variables (`base`, `refiner`, `latents`, `text_encoder_2`, `vae`) initialized to `None` before `try`. `finally` deletes all five unconditionally — safe even when `base=None` mid-refine.

**Decision:** APPROVED.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #8: README Update (MPS Support, Testing, Memory Model, Batch Gen) — MERGED

**Sprint:** CI, README, TDD Sprint

**Changes made:**
- Added MPS support section with device detection guidance
- Updated Testing section with pytest instructions and test counts (22 regression tests)
- Documented memory management model (try/finally cleanup, inter-item cache flush, exception safety)
- Added Batch Generation feature overview
- Scoped pytest command to `pytest tests/test_memory_cleanup.py -v` (22 green tests only, avoiding TDD red-phase failures)

**Review flow:**
1. Trinity reviewed PR #8: APPROVED (all technical claims verified accurate)
2. Neo reviewed PR #8: REJECTED (initial pytest command showed 22 failures from TDD red-phase tests)
3. Trinity fixed scoping on `squad/readme-update` branch (commit scoped to test_memory_cleanup.py)
4. Neo re-reviewed PR #8 after fix: APPROVED
5. PR #8 merged to main (squash)

**Status:** ✅ MERGED

**Architectural note:** README now correctly explains the memory model and batch generation as design decisions, not just features. Readers understand why `generate()` flushes GPU state and how batch workflows should manage inter-iteration cleanup.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #7 Code Review CONDITIONAL REJECT (TDD Red-Phase Tests)

**Sprint:** TDD Batch Generation + OOM Handling

**Initial Assessment:** PR #7 adds batch generation feature with TDD red-phase tests (`test_batch_generation.py` + `test_oom_handling.py`). Tests intentionally fail (TDD red phase). Running `pytest tests/ -v` runs 53 tests:
- 22 regression tests (test_memory_cleanup.py) — PASSING
- 17 batch generation tests (test_batch_generation.py) — RED (expected to fail, not yet implemented)
- 14 OOM handling tests (test_oom_handling.py) — RED (expected to fail, not yet implemented)

**Rejection Basis:** PR #7 must not land with failing tests in the `tests/` scope. Adding TDD red-phase tests to the suite breaks CI/CD. Either:
1. Scope the failing tests out of pytest's default run (e.g., move to `tests/tdd/` and exempt from `pytest tests/ -v`), OR
2. Wait for the implementation PRs to land first, so tests pass when added.

**Conditional Approval:** "After pytest scope is corrected, this PR will be APPROVED."

**Resolution:** Trinity completed TDD green phase (PR #9). All 53 tests now pass. Tested on squad/tdd-batch-oom-tests branch:
```
$ python -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | tail -1
============================== 53 passed in 2.45s ==============================
```

**Re-Assessment (2026-03-25):**
- Rejection condition: "pytest scope must not have failing tests" ✅ **SATISFIED** (via implementation, not structural change)
- All 53 tests passing — 22 regression + 17 batch gen + 14 OOM handling
- No test failures blocking CI
- Code changes architecturally sound: batch generation follows existing memory cleanup patterns, OOM handling properly routes exceptions

**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVED** — PR #7 ready to merge. Rejection condition satisfied by test implementation completing green phase rather than test refactoring. Both paths lead to passing pytest scope.

### 2026-03-25 — PR #9 Code Review: OOMError + batch_generate() — APPROVE ✅

**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVE — Merge to main**

**Sprint:** TDD Green Phase (batch generation + OOM handling)  
**Status:** All 53 tests pass

**Summary:**
Reviewed Trinity's implementation of OOMError and batch_generate() against 10-point code review checklist. All criteria met.

**OOMError (class, lines 20-22, except clause lines 197-207):**
1. ✅ Subclasses RuntimeError (line 20)
2. ✅ CUDA OOM detection: isinstance(exc, torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError) with hasattr guard (lines 198-200)
3. ✅ MPS OOM detection: isinstance(exc, RuntimeError) and "out of memory" in str(exc).lower() (line 202)
4. ✅ finally block executes after OOM (lines 208-222 guaranteed by Python finally semantics)
5. ✅ Error message actionable: "Out of GPU memory. Reduce steps with --steps or switch to CPU with --cpu." (line 205) — mentions both --steps AND --cpu
6. ✅ Non-OOM exceptions not swallowed: bare `raise` on line 207 re-raises non-OOM exceptions

**batch_generate() (lines 227-270):**
1. ✅ Calls generate() once per item (loop lines 235-248)
2. ✅ GPU memory flush BETWEEN items: gc.collect() + torch.cuda.empty_cache() + guarded torch.mps.empty_cache() on lines 264-268, guarded by `if i < len(prompts) - 1` so flush occurs between items, not after last
3. ✅ Per-item failure graceful: try/except around generate() (lines 247-261), appends error dict with exception message, continues
4. ✅ Empty list returns [] immediately: for loop on empty list yields no iterations, no generate() or gc calls
5. ✅ Result order preserved: iterates and appends in order
6. ✅ Never raises on all-failures: all exceptions converted to error dicts in results list
7. ✅ Signature clean: `batch_generate(prompts: list[dict], device: str = "mps") -> list[dict]` matches spec

**Integration:**
8. ✅ Existing try/finally cleanup functional: all code intact (lines 137-224)
9. ✅ OOM except clause does not interfere: re-raised as OOMError (RuntimeError subclass), finally executes normally after except
10. ✅ Code readable and maintainable: inline comments explain Fixes 1–3; clear logic; good variable names

**Test Coverage:** 53 tests all passing (2.67s)
- 22 regression tests (existing memory cleanup)
- 17 batch_generate() tests (per-item call, inter-item flushing, failure handling, ordering, edge cases)
- 14 OOMError tests (CUDA OOM, MPS OOM, message content, finally cleanup, state clean after OOM)

**Quality Assessment:**
- Exception safety guaranteed (finally block unconditional)
- OOMError design correct (dual detection, version-safe guards, actionable message)
- batch_generate() contract clean (no abort on per-item failure, order preserved, never raises)
- No functional bugs found
- Code maintainable and tested

**Minor observations (non-blocking):**
- MPS cache clear in batch_generate could be device-guarded (currently just is_available()), but safe no-op on non-MPS devices
- torch.cuda.empty_cache() called unconditionally on all devices in batch, but safe no-op pattern consistent with generate() line 214

**Result:** Production-ready. Both OOMError and batch_generate() are fully implemented and tested. Ready to merge.

---

**Decision:** ✅ APPROVE — Merge to main. All tests pass, all acceptance criteria met, no bugs found, code is maintainable and production-ready.

### 2026-03-24 — Code Review PR #10: OOM Auto-Retry (generate_with_retry)

**Assignment:** Code review of Trinity's PR #10 (squad/oom-retry)

**Feature Reviewed:** generate_with_retry(args, max_retries=2) implementation for OOMError handling with step reduction

**Review Findings:**
1. **Correctness:** Correctly implements step halving (floor at 1), retries on OOMError, prints warnings, re-raises with context on exhaustion. Verified by 12 passing tests.
2. **Regressions:** main() logic updated correctly to dispatch to generate_with_retry for single-prompt mode while preserving batch mode path. Argument parsing ensures mutual exclusivity.
3. **Safety:** Retry loop respects existing finally cleanup in generate().
4. **Testing:** 12 tests cover all critical paths including edge cases (steps=1 floor, max_retries exhaustion).
5. **CI:** No new workflows added.

**Architectural Recommendation (Deferred):** Future work should update batch_generate() to utilize generate_with_retry() logic for consistent OOM handling across both single-prompt and batch modes. Currently batch fails immediately on OOM for a single item while single-prompt mode retries. Acceptable for this PR's scope but represents architectural inconsistency. Noted in decisions.md as future enhancement.

**Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED — Ready to merge to main

**PR Status:** ✅ MERGED to main

**Test Impact:**
- 12/12 test_oom_retry.py tests pass (all of Neo's red-phase contracts satisfied)
- Zero regressions in full test suite
